## Chooser

A web page that lets you choose a random item (or multiple items) from a list (or multiple lists) and save
the list(s) as a URL.

If you want to share a chooser, I suggest sharing a gist that contains the permalink. That way if you modify your list
you can update the gist and not have to reshare the link, since the URL is different any time you make changes.

If your lists are too long, things might break.
